<description>I haven't used this in a bit, but I definitely should ã… ã…  anyways, I'm working on a section for my fanlistings!! I guess it'll sort of be a fanlistings collective, since I also want to have a section for fanlistings I own/help run... I'm working on it, so we'll have to see how that goes :D</description>

<title>blog reconfiguration :/</title>

<description>I initially set up my blog (in the blog section) with the intention of making a suuuuuper easy-to-use blog that I wouldn't have to put effort into formatting, and to be fair, it worked!! But it also got mildly annoying that I can't put pictures or links, and that's discouraged me from using it &#128128; I think I'm gonna redo it so that it's all in html, it shouldn't take that long, but it'll be SO worth it in the end :D</description>

<description>I find it a little silly that I have this little microblog-ish thing when I'm on two microblogging platforms and I've very much been regular blogging on this site... but speaking of, I'm currently working on some things that mean that, in essence, I should be able to switch to a neocities domain relatively soon! That's not a HUGE promise considering that I mean relatively in the sense that it took me eight months to get this site up in the first place, but it is a promise nonetheless :'D </description>

<description>yet another disappearance and a surprising(?) amount of work later, but FINALLY THE SITE IS HOSTED!!! Currently, it's up on Netlify, and that's already working pretty well! Still, I do intend to put this thing on Neocities, it's just a matter of when :') while one wait is finally over, another begins, and I'M LIVING FOR IT TBH BC I'M VERY EXCITED</description>

<description>I'm getting through this WAYYY faster than I expected, even though I still can't host it for a few months ðŸ˜” although, I do have one section left that idk what to do with. I don't want to dedicate myself to a text blog when I know I won't end up doing it, and I don't want to make a music section when I have an entire website dedicated to my music, so what so I do?? I'll have to figure it out at some point, but still ðŸ˜­</description>

<description>I'm setting this up still and ik I won't be making it public for a long time but IT'S SO FUN ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ Also I'm specifically making a shrine abt Madds Buckley bc,,, obviously I am, though I literally just ripped off my own design that I made for my web design class ðŸ˜­ tbf I literally did that assignment about her, so at least it's not like I didn't make it about her in the first place ðŸ« </description>

<description><![CDATA[ I just wanna test out something, soooo- HEY LOOK, A BUTTON! <br><br> <img src="http://baileylockheart.netlify.app/images/button.gif"><br><br> okay,,,, hopefully that works ðŸ˜­ I'm very much new to this whole rss feed thing, but I wanna be able to use html type stuff in it, too! I like the idea of turning this into a full-on microblog thing as opposed to the one on my music site, which is more simple. I should probably add the titles to that one though ðŸ¥² ]]></description>

<description>why is the concept of a new website tearing my brain apart from the inside out ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ like I am SO invested, I'm away from my computer bc I'm supposed to be sleeping and even now I just CAN'T. STOP. THINKING?? Like I'm literally using this bc I already said gn on threads (my main social media) and now I'm scrolling on tumblr of all places, looking at people saying fun it is to make a website</description>

<description>NEW WEBSITE NEW WEBSITE!!! I'm very excited abt this one since it's my first fully personal, not-in-character-as-someone-else, personal site! I'm still working out what to put in it, and as of writing this, the website it's meant for actually isn't up yet, but I'm gonna keep updating this as I go :D</description>
