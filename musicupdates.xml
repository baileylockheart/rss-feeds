<description>I MADE AN RSS FEED ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤© I felt like I didn't really update this thing enough, and I could just FEEL that it was bc I didn't want to go on my computer to update the html file. Bc of that, I made a little rss feed and stuck it on github so I can use it from my phone!</description>

<description>I wanna learn to do more electronic-y music production ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ it seems so fun + the timing might be easier since you can quantize stuff (or whatever it is) as opposed to trying to line it all up with my 53rd messy take of guitar</description>
