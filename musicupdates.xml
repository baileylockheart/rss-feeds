<title>â™¡ Overhaul Time â™¡</title>

<description>This website has existed in some form or another for over two years now, and it hasn't changed much (visually) in that time, even though I feel like I've changed a lot as a person. Because of that, I'm going to be attempting a complete and total overhaul for this website, as well as my general "brand" if you could call it that? I'll be archiving the current layout, so it won't disappear, but hopefully the newer one will be more fitting :D</description>

<description>Even though this is my more-professional website, I really wanted to connect it to the personal web as I like it. I mean, it's hand-coded by me, so why not? So, I moved my link button and webrings to the front page! I'm trying to figure out the extent to which I'll link to other sites, and I'm sure that if I ever go 10000% professional, this stuff would have to go to a dedicated page instead, but for now, I'm really happy with it :3</description>

<description>I've been working on recording my next big project for quite a while now, and it's taking WAYYYY longer than expected ã… ã…  however! in the meantime, I'm working on putting up more videos on youtube, both originals and a few covers ^^ I don't have an uploading schedule or anything, but generally, I'm gonna try to make videos more often, while still recording as well!!</description>

<description>at the rate I'm getting this recording done and the amount of time I want to allow myself so I can have presave links/promo videos set up, I might not be releasing anything new until WINTER ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ my fault for not dropping the hanquokka song as a single when I was done with it ðŸ¥²ðŸ’” I'll start doing singles between big projects after this one, but UGH I really hope I can get this done before it's been a full year since my last release ðŸ˜­</description>

<description>I need to get better at music production :/ like, two guitar tracks + midi bass and enough harmonies to break my headphones is fun and all, and I'd probably keep those even if I learned to do it better, but I need to at LEAST learn how to play guitar with a metronome without messing up ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ I wanna have fun drums/beats/percussion-y things in my music but idk how to do it yet, and it's hard when my stuff is all human timing :/</description>

<description><![CDATA[ I wanna make more music but my time management is dead rn ðŸ˜­ istg once school is over I'll hopefully have calmed down with my brain doing everything to avoid said school, so I'm gonna speedrun production as fast as I can (without making it sound rushed ofc) and get it out asap after that ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ <br><br> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/baileylockheart/rss-feeds/main/images/everskies-skzmeme.jpeg" style="width:300px">]]>

<description>I MADE AN RSS FEED ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤© I felt like I didn't really update this thing enough, and I could just FEEL that it was bc I didn't want to go on my computer to update the html file. Bc of that, I made a little rss feed and stuck it on github so I can use it from my phone!</description>

<description>I wanna learn to do more electronic-y music production ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ it seems so fun + the timing might be easier since you can quantize stuff (or whatever it is) as opposed to trying to line it all up with my 53rd messy take of guitar</description>

I think this is will be a fun little place for updates and announcements!</description>
